TableStory is a mobile web app made with VueJS, Bootstrap and SCSS. TableStory is a platform that aims to create a social community of food enthusiasts by connecting users with recommended eateries based on the food pictures on their devices. We used Python and Tensorflow to train an image-recognition model that detects food items in images and categorizes them by their specific food name (e.g. pizza). Through uploading their food pictures and posting them onto their profile, they create a food identity, or 'TableStory', and can easily connect with other users who share the same food interests.
